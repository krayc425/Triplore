# Triplore (English)

This project was submitted for the [2017 iQiyi National Programming Contest](https://www.nowcoder.com/activity/iqiyi2017) and won the **First Prize** and **Best Individual**.

The name **Triplore** is the combination of **Trip** and **Explore**, hoping it can help users grab useful information from massive online videos, and combine these information into a piece of note which can be reviewed when travelling.

# Instruction„ÄêImportant„Äë

Unfortunately, the video player library `libav.a` provided by iQiyi is in 32 bit architecture and Apple requires that all apps are compiled under 64 bit architecture, so this project **can not** run very much likely. Please just refer to the source code and idea.
